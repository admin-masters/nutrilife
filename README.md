# Nutrilift_second_cycle

This is the continuation of the project "Nutrilift" with some major changes and hence it is in a new repository.

Changes I did to the project

1. In settings.py I made some changes I loaded the .env using dotenv. I also made a isdocker() function and used it. I also changed the value of two variables:CELERY_BROKER_URL and CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND
2. I also did some change in ratelimiting.py.

Test 2
